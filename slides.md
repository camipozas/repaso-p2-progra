# What is Docker?
It is a software platform that allows you to quickly build, test, and deploy applications.

- 📦 **Packages** Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that include everything needed for the software to run, including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime.
- 🐳 **Container** Really allows us to encapsulate, that is, pack software inside said container using the microservices architecture.

# Process of creating a container in Docker

In addition, it is necessary to clarify that within the container a series of instructions **(dockerfile)** are defined that allow creating an image **(docker image)** with which to start said container **(docker container)**.[^1]

1. 🐳 **Dockerfile:** it is the text document on which we can group a series of commands so that they are all executed at the same time, thus avoiding having to execute them one by one manually so that the process of creating a Docker image is much easier. faster and more efficient.
2. 🖼️ **Docker image:** a Docker image, contains the libraries, along with the application code that contains everything necessary to run our application.
3. 📦 **Container:** It is a Docker image when it starts working, that is, when it comes to life.

# How to make a Dockerfile?
This file is made up of a series of commands that I will indicate below, and that are responsible for [building the image.](https://atareao.es/tutorial/docker/crear-tus-propias-imagenes-docker/)

### Docker Commands
|     |     |
| --- | --- |
<kbd>ADD</kbd> | copies a file from the host to the container.
<kbd>CMD</kbd> | the argument you pass by default.
<kbd>ENTRYPOINT</kbd> | the command that is executed by default when starting the container.
<kbd>ENV</kbd> | allows you to declare an environment variable in the container.
<kbd>EXPOSE</kbd> | open a container port.
<kbd>FROM</kbd> | indicates the base image that you will use to build your custom image. This option is required, and must also be the first instruction in the Dockerfile.

---

# Docker Commands
|     |     |
| --- | --- |
<kbd>ONBUILD</kbd> | allows you to indicate a command that is executed when your image is used to create another image.
<kbd>RUN</kbd> | run a command and save the result as a new layer.
<kbd>USER</kbd> | defines the default user of the container.
<kbd>VOLUME</kbd> | creates a volume that is shared by the different containers or with the host.
<kbd>WORKDIR</kbd> | defines the working directory for the container.
<kbd>LABEL</kbd> | instruction adds metadata to an image. A <kbd>LABEL</kbd> is a key-value pair.
<kbd>VOLUME</kbd> | instruction creates a mount point with the specified name and marks it as holding externally mounted volumes from native host or other containers.

# Basic Example

```docker {all|1-4|6-9|10-11|13|15-16|all}
FROM python:3.9

ENV APP_HOME /usr/src/app
WORKDIR /$APP_HOME

# Install python dependencies
COPY requirements.txt /tmp/
RUN pip install --requirement /tmp/requirements.txt
RUN pip freeze
# Copy env variables
ADD .env .env

COPY . $APP_HOME/

# Run
CMD python main.py
```
